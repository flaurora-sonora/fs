# fs
fs is pretty much only good currently for filesystem navigation and backups done through the browser. The filesystems of many 
drives is presented as though those drives were a single drive and so stuff like having multiple program files folders over many 
drives is less problematic when trying to remember where something may be saved. A shortcut is placed on the windows desktop after
navigating to a specific file through fs and <a href="https://github.com/flaurora-sonora/fractal_zip">fractal_zip</a> is also 
integrated.
