# fs
Version 0.2

This is a fun update with lots of changes. fs now uses the excellent <a href="https://www.datatables.net/">datatables.js</a> to provide file exploration functionality. name, date modified, size, extension, times accessed, name score, contents score, compression socre and additional actions appear as sortable hideable columns. There is also filtering and dark/light theme and text/icon mode. There are also additional things that may or may not work currently including file backup and restore, keywords searching, fractal_zip integration, one-click file navigation, recursive directory listing.

Version 0.1

fs is pretty much only good currently for filesystem navigation and backups done through the browser. The filesystems of many 
drives is presented as though those drives were a single drive and so stuff like having multiple program files folders over many 
drives is less problematic when trying to remember where something may be saved. A shortcut is placed on the windows desktop after
navigating to a specific file through fs and <a href="https://github.com/flaurora-sonora/fractal_zip">fractal_zip</a> is also 
integrated.
